One of the most common problems users face is the inability to log in to their Avast account. If you're encountering issues with Avast login, here are some steps to resolve them:

- **Forgotten Password**: If you’ve forgotten your password, use the password recovery feature on the login page. Avast will send a link to reset your password.
- **Incorrect Email**: Double-check that the email address you’re using matches the one associated with your Avast account.
- **Account Lockout**: If you’ve attempted too many failed logins, your account might be temporarily locked for security purposes. Wait a few minutes and try again.
